# Astronomy Pic of the Day
This application is built in Vue, utilizing the NASA image API to dynamically display NASA's Astronomy of the Day, featuring stunning photos of space taken by astronauts, photographers, and deep space equipment.

### Stack:
- VueJS
- Webpack
- Vue datetime library
- Vue router
- Vuex
- Heroku

### Planning
This project was built to spec for a Turing School project, requiring that images be displayed from the NASA APOD API but with little else in terms of requirements. The layout draws inspiration from some common photo gallery sites.

Pre-planning/user stories can be seen on the [project board attached to the repo, here.](https://github.com/VPAbraham/astronomy-pic-otd/projects/1)
